  "description": "<p><strong>DBM-COT (Digital Brain Model – Chain of Thought)</strong> is released as a DOI-anchored, citation-stable research chain documenting the incremental formation of <strong>Structural Intelligence</strong> within the Digital Brain Model (DBM) framework.</p><p>This release (v1.1) establishes DBM-COT as a <em>structured and traceable chain of reasoning, design, and construction</em>—not as a passive text corpus, dataset, or a set of independent papers. It is intended as a reconstructable research record enabling long-horizon reference, verification, and extension independent of transient AI models, datasets, or proprietary systems.</p><p>Scope note: v1.1 provides the first structurally complete and citation-stable baseline of the DBM-COT chain (ITEM #1–#170), including a dedicated consolidation layer for paradigms, evolution mechanisms, and governance-level reflections (ITEM #154–#170).</p>",
