# ENTRY — Top-20 Structural Intelligence Algorithms  
## Digital Brain Model (DBM-COT, Release 1.2)

This document presents the **Top-20 core algorithms and principles** of  
**DBM Structural Intelligence (DBM-SI)**.

This list is **structural and foundational**, not historical or benchmark-driven.

- It does **not** rank algorithms by popularity, performance scores, or industry adoption.
- It intentionally excludes secondary optimizations and implementation-level tricks.
- It focuses on **irreducible algorithmic pillars** that define DBM as a
  *structure-first intelligence system*.

Together, these algorithms address:

- representation and perspective,
- search and combinatorial control,
- reusable intelligence compression,
- sequence and time-series reasoning,
- autonomous systems,
- and hybrid intelligence with LLMs.

## How to Use This Table

- **New readers**: use this table as a *map*, not a reading checklist  
- **Engineers**: identify which algorithms form your system’s backbone  
- **Researchers**: evaluate DBM by structural coverage, not isolated tricks  

Each algorithm corresponds to one or more **DBM-COT ITEMs**, each with:
- an English **LITE** navigation file,
- a formal **ITEM PDF**,
- and a full **Conversation PDF** documenting its research evolution.

## Positioning Note

This Top-20 intentionally mixes:

- algorithms,
- architectural mechanisms,
- and governing principles.

In DBM, **principles that constrain intelligence growth are as critical as algorithms that compute**.

---

## Closing Perspective

DBM does not compete on speed, scale, or benchmarks.

It competes on **structural completeness, controllability, and long-term viability**.

This Top-20 defines the **irreducible core** of that approach.
