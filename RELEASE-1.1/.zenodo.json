  "description": "DBM-COT (Digital Brain Model – Chain of Thought) is released as a DOI-anchored, citation-stable research chain documenting the incremental formation of Structural Intelligence within the Digital Brain Model framework. This release (v1.1) establishes DBM-COT as a structured and traceable chain of reasoning, design, and construction, rather than a passive text corpus or dataset. DBM-COT v1.1 provides the first structurally complete and stable baseline of the chain (ITEM #1–#170), intended for long-horizon reference, reconstruction, and scholarly citation.",
