### DBM-COT v1.1 — Academic Release Notes

**Digital Brain Model – Chain of Thought (DBM-COT)**

#### Release Scope and Intent

Version **v1.1** marks the first **structurally complete and citation-stable release** of the Digital Brain Model – Chain of Thought (DBM-COT).
This release consolidates DBM-COT as a coherent, traceable research chain documenting the formation of **Structural Intelligence** within the Digital Brain Model framework.

Rather than representing incremental content expansion, v1.1 formalizes DBM-COT as a **paradigm-level research artifact**, suitable for long-term reference, reconstruction, and scholarly citation.

#### What This Release Establishes

**1. DBM-COT as a Chain, Not a Collection**
v1.1 explicitly defines DBM-COT as a structured chain of reasoning, design, and construction.
All core texts, indexes, and summaries consistently reinforce DBM-COT’s identity as a traceable process rather than a passive corpus or document repository.

**2. Canonical Terminology and Conceptual Stability**
This release locks down a Terminology Canon for DBM-COT, ensuring consistent use of foundational concepts such as *Chain of Thought*, *ITEM*, and *Structural Intelligence*.
Semantic drift and paradigm ambiguity are explicitly avoided.

**3. Complete ITEM Chain Coverage (ITEM #1–#170)**
DBM-COT v1.1 includes a fully articulated ITEM chain, culminating in ITEM #170, which provides philosophical and structural closure at the paradigm and civilizational levels.
The chain spans foundational methods, core structural mechanisms, evolutionary engines, and long-horizon reflections.

**4. Paradigm Consolidation Layer (ITEM #154–#170)**
A dedicated consolidation layer formalizes DBM as a third paradigm of artificial intelligence, distinct from symbolic and connectionist approaches.
This layer integrates paradigm definition, comparative analysis, constructive evolution, governance principles, and reflective synthesis.

**5. Index-Level Navigability and Reconstructability**
The ITEM_INDEX and accompanying navigation guides establish DBM-COT as a reconstructable reasoning process.
Readers are guided to follow structural progression and dependency, rather than isolated reading.

#### Intended Use

DBM-COT v1.1 is released as:

* A **research reference** for Structural Intelligence and constructive AI paradigms
* A **design lineage record** enabling future reconstruction and extension
* A **teaching and exploration resource** for readers interested in structure-driven intelligence systems

This release is **not positioned as a final theory**, nor as a benchmark-driven system comparison.
It is a **foundational chain**, intended to remain interpretable and relevant independent of transient AI models, datasets, or optimization trends.

---

#### Stability and Future Evolution

Version v1.1 is considered **conceptually stable** at the level of:

* Core terminology
* Chain structure
* Paradigm positioning

Future releases may extend DBM-COT through additional ITEMS, implementations, or empirical studies, but will treat v1.1 as a **fixed historical baseline** rather than a mutable draft.

---

#### Citation and Preservation

DBM-COT v1.1 is released under a DOI-anchored archival strategy to ensure long-term accessibility, citability, and scholarly integrity.
While archived for preservation, the core identity of DBM-COT remains that of a **chain of thought**, not a static corpus.

---

*DBM-COT v1.1 represents the first completed articulation of the Digital Brain Model as a Structural Intelligence research paradigm.*
*Subsequent work builds upon this foundation.*
