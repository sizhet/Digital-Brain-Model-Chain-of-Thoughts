## What is DBM?

DBM (Digital Brain Model) is a structural approach to intelligence engineering. DBM-COT is the **“Chain of Thoughts”** layer; other planned layers include:

- **DBM-COA**: Chain of Algorithms (code & runtime)
- **DBM-COS**: Chain of Solutions (applied frameworks)

DBM-COT focuses on: *clear structure, reproducible reasoning, and engineering-ready decomposition*.
