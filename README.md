# Digital Brain Model Chain-of-Thoughts Documents (DBM-COT)

> A structural corpus of 170+ evolving ITEMS that define the **Digital Brain Model (DBM)** paradigm — from metric-space intelligence to autonomous programming and multi-agent cognitive geometry.

## 1. What is DBM-COT?

DBM-COT (Digital Brain Model — Corpus of Thought) is a long-term, evolving knowledge base that captures:

- The **core concepts** of the Digital Brain Model (DBM)
- 150+ **ITEMs** (and growing) with:
  - Canonical Summary
  - Enhanced Edition (later refinements)
  - Evolution Notes
  - Cross-References
  - Keywords
- A complete **structural map** of DBM’s algorithms, architectures, and philosophical foundations

DBM stands for a **Third Paradigm of AI**:  
not symbolic AI, not matrix-only LLM AI, but **structural, metric, and mutation-driven intelligence**.

For a full narrative, see:

- `summary/DBM-COT-v1.1-CN.md` (coming as a mirrored Chinese edition)
