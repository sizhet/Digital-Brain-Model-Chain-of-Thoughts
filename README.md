## What is DBM-COT?

DBM-COT (Chain of Thoughts) is the conceptual and architectural layer of the
Digital Brain Model ecosystem. It organizes structural intelligence into
modular components including localization, metric alignment, CCC formation,
alignment dispatching, rule engines, ACLM execution graphs, IR layers, and
evolution mechanisms.

Rather than focusing on a single algorithmic paradigm, DBM-SI explores
**structural coverage of intelligence systems**.
