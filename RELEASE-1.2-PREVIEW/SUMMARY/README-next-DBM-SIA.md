# DBM-SIA / DBM-COT
## Structural Intelligence as an Evolutionary Open-Source System

DBM-SIA (Differential Brain Model – Structural Intelligence Architecture) is a long-term public research and engineering effort dedicated to building **intelligent systems that can be understood, inherited, and continuously evolved**.

This repository hosts **DBM-COT (Chain-of-Thought)** — a structured collection of research ITEMS, algorithms, and executable skeletons forming the first-generation public foundation of DBM-SIA.

## What Is DBM-SIA?

DBM-SIA is **not**:
- a single AI model  
- a framework or toolkit  
- a collection of optimization tricks  

DBM-SIA **is**:
> **an evolutionary open-source system for structural intelligence**.

Its core goal is to answer a question most AI systems ignore:

> **How can an intelligent system be inherited and evolved by the next generation?**

---

## Core Principles

- Intelligence is not only in data and parameters, but in **structure**
- Problem structures matter more than final answers
- Stop-Rules and Contracts are first-class citizens
- **Inheritors matter more than users**

DBM-SIA therefore adopts a different open-source paradigm:

> **Open-source is not the release of results,  
but the construction of a shared structural-intelligence field  
that can be entered, inherited, and further evolved.**

## DBM-COT and ITEMs

Research outputs are published as **DBM-COT ITEMs**:

- each ITEM is a locatable and inheritable structural node  
- each algorithm operates under explicit contracts and stop-rules  
- each code artifact serves long-term system evolution  

### First Public Generation
**ITEMs #1–#137** form the **first-generation public skeleton**, covering:
- Structural Intelligence foundations  
- Differential Trees  
- CCC (Common Concept Core)  
- IR (Information Representation)  
- ACLM (Abstract Cognitive Language Model)  

These ITEMS are **not final answers**, but starting points.

## What Comes Next?

After ITEM #137, DBM-COT enters a new phase.

**ITEMs #173–#255** focus on:
- structural convergence  
- engineering survivability  
- cross-domain reuse  
- inheritance and evolution under real-world constraints

**[`What-Comes-Next.md`](What-Comes-Next.en.md)**

> If DBM-COT #1–#137 asked whether structural intelligence exists,  
> #173–#255 ask whether it can survive reality.

## Who Is This For?

DBM-SIA is for readers who:
- want to understand AI beyond model usage  
- care about interpretability, maintainability, and long-term evolution  
- aim to build intelligent systems that can outlive their creators  

If you are only looking for a ready-made tool,  
this may not be the shortest path.
