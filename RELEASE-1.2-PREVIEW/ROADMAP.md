# DBM-COT Roadmap

This roadmap describes the evolution of DBM from conceptual foundations
to deployable structural intelligence systems.

It is organized by **structural readiness**, not hype cycles.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Completed)

**Goal**: Establish the structural ontology of intelligence.

Key outcomes:
- Structure as the carrier of intelligence
- CCC as the minimal reusable intelligence unit
- Differential trees as the core search and reasoning fabric
- Clear separation between structure and generation

Representative ITEMS:
- #173 IRStarmap
- #179 Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence
- #180 CCC Core
- #242 Taming the Thousand-Claw Dragon

Status: ✅ Complete and frozen (Release 1.1)

---

## Phase I — Algorithmic Backbone (Active)

**Goal**: Make structural intelligence computationally viable.

Key developments:
- ACLM gap geometry (horizontal + vertical bridging)
- UnalignedAND-BTP fish-control backbone
- Hybrid differential trees
- Sequence CCC Kernel

Representative ITEMS:
- #177–#191 ACLM Gap Bridging Series
- #229–#235 UnalignedAND-BTP & Hybrid Trees
- #240 Sequence CCC Kernel

Status: 🔧 Actively refined (Release 1.2)

---

## Phase II — Intelligence Mechanisms (Next)

**Goal**: Formalize reasoning, evaluation, and decision-action loops.

Focus areas:
- Knowing–Doing Co-Progress Intelligence (KD-CPI)
- Structural evaluation beyond benchmarks
- Post-hoc evolutionary CCC formation
- Cross-domain reasoning stability

Representative ITEMS:
- #196 CCC as Post-hoc Evolution
- #200–#202 KD-CPI & Evaluation
- #212 LLM + DBM Replication Path

Status: 🧠 Conceptually stable, engineering in progress

---

## Phase III — Systems & Civilization (Emerging)

**Goal**: Scale structural intelligence to systems, agents, and society.

Focus areas:
- DBM Structure Intelligence Agents (DBM-SIA)
- AI safety via structural governance
- Open-source evolutionary intelligence
- Civilization-level accumulation of structure

Representative ITEMS:
- #245–#247 DBM-SIA
- #250 AI Safety Beyond Prompts
- #252 AI Panorama Map

Status: 🌍 Early emergence, long-term direction set

---

## Guiding Principles

- Prefer **structural control** over brute-force optimization
- Prefer **reusable intelligence** over one-off solutions
- Prefer **explicit representations** over opaque embeddings
- Prefer **evolutionary readiness** over AGI hype

---

## What Comes Next

- Complete DBM-COA reference implementations for Tier S + Tier A
- Publish Sequence CCC and Time-Series IR pipelines
- Release DBM-SIA minimal agents
- Expand DBM-COS end-to-end demos

DBM progresses when **structure is ready**, not when attention spikes.
