## Relationship to Other DBM Artifacts

- **DBM-COT**: Conceptual and structural reasoning
- **DBM-COA**: Algorithmic realizations
- **DBM-COS**: System-level applications
- **DBM-SIA**: Agent and evolutionary integration

This summary document acts as the **conceptual index layer** across all four.

## Closing Note

DBM-COT Summary v1.2 is intentionally **incomplete by design**.  
It reflects a living structure, not a closed theory.

The purpose of this document is not to conclude,  
but to **orient, connect, and enable further construction**.
