# ENTRY — Researchers  
## Structural Intelligence, Evaluation, and Governance (DBM-COT)

This entry is for **researchers interested in the foundations of intelligence**:
what it is, how it accumulates, how it should be evaluated, and how it can be governed.

DBM-COT does not propose a new loss function or a new scaling law.
It proposes a **structural ontology of intelligence**.

---

## What DBM Claims (and What It Does Not)

### DBM Claims

- Intelligence is carried by **structure**, not parameters
- Reusable intelligence emerges from **post-hoc structural compression (CCC)**
- Evaluation must go **beyond benchmark performance**
- Long-term intelligence requires **governance and evolutionary constraints**

### DBM Does Not Claim

- That scale alone produces intelligence
- That world-model simulation can replay evolution
- That passing tests implies understanding
- That AGI timelines are meaningful without structural readiness

---

## Core Research Themes

### 1️⃣ Structure vs Parameters (Ontology)

**Key idea:** Parameters store experience; structure stores intelligence.

- **Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence** — ITEM #179  
- **CCC as the Compression Core** — ITEM #180  
- **CCC as Post-hoc Evolutionary Structure** — ITEM #196  

DBM treats structure as:
- transferable
- comparable
- composable
- evolvable

This contrasts with parameter-centric views dominant in deep learning.

---

### 2️⃣ Minimal Evolution Threshold & Path Dependency

**Key idea:** Intelligence growth has entry thresholds and irreversible paths.

- **Minimal Evolution Threshold** — ITEM #253  
- **Limits of World Models** — ITEM #176  

DBM argues that:
- evolution cannot be replayed
- intelligence cannot be shortcut by simulation
- structure determines reachability of future capabilities

---

### 3️⃣ Evaluation Beyond Benchmarks (Post-Turing)

**Key idea:** Passing tests is insufficient for measuring intelligence.

- **AGI Time Windows vs Structural Readiness** — ITEM #192  
- **Turing Window Fallacy** — ITEM #193  
- **Post-Turing Evaluation** — ITEM #194  

DBM proposes evaluation based on:
- structural consistency
- entropy control
- long-horizon stability
- decision invariants

---

### 4️⃣ Knowing–Doing Co-Progress Intelligence (KD-CPI)

**Key idea:** Knowing and acting co-evolve under uncertainty.

- **KD-CPI** — ITEM #200  
- **Unified Evaluation Framework** — ITEM #202  

KD-CPI rejects the assumption that complete knowledge precedes action,
aligning more closely with biological and real-world intelligence.

---

### 5️⃣ Structural Positioning of Modern AI (Panorama)

**Key idea:** AI methods occupy different structural layers.

- **AI Panorama Map** — ITEM #252  

The panorama clarifies:
- why debates often talk past each other
- why LLM success does not imply structural completeness
- where DBM fills missing layers

This map serves as a **global coordinate system** for AI research.

---

## LLMs, RAG, and Structural Tensions

DBM treats LLMs as powerful **generative components**, not decision authorities.

- **LLM as How-Machine vs DBM as What-Engine** — ITEM #186  
- **Unified LLM + DBM Model** — ITEM #248  
- **RAG / Continual Learning Tensions** — ITEM #249  
- **CCC Density & Deductive Weakness** — ITEM #251  

These ITEMS analyze:
- why dense knowledge can degrade deduction
- why naïve continual learning destabilizes reasoning
- why structural governance is required

---

## Agents, Governance, and AI Safety

DBM explicitly treats governance as a **structural problem**, not a policy afterthought.

- **Structure Intelligence Agent (SIA)** — ITEM #245  
- **DBM-SIA Evolutionary Open-Source Paradigm** — ITEM #246  
- **DBM-SIA Manifesto** — ITEM #247  
- **AI Safety Beyond Prompts** — ITEM #250  
- **AI Governance Without Damaging AI Development** — ITEM #255  

Key positions:
- regulate structure, not thought
- education and structure outperform coercion
- safety must scale with intelligence

---

## How Researchers Should Read DBM-COT

1. **Start with LITE files** for orientation  
2. Read ITEM PDFs selectively, by theme  
3. Treat Conversation PDFs as **research traces**, not noise  

You are not expected to agree with every position.
DBM is designed to be **critiqued structurally**, not accepted wholesale.

---

## Suggested Minimal Reading Set (Researcher Edition)

Read **LITE versions** of:

1. ITEM #252 — AI Panorama Map  
2. ITEM #179 — Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence  
3. ITEM #180 — CCC Core  
4. ITEM #192 — Structural Readiness vs AGI Timelines  
5. ITEM #200 — KD-CPI  

This set is sufficient to understand DBM’s **theoretical stance**.

---

## Final Note for Researchers

DBM-COT is intentionally conservative in claims
and aggressive in structural demands.

It does not ask whether intelligence is possible.
It asks whether intelligence is **structurally supported**.

That distinction is the core research contribution.
