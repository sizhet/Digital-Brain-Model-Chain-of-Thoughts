## 🚀 DBM-COT Release 1.2 (Panorama Preview)

This release introduces the **AI 4-Layers Panorama Map** and a structurally aligned
preview of DBM-COT ITEM #173–#252.

Release 1.2 does **not** replace Release 1.1.  
Instead, it provides a **global coordinate system** that makes the entire DBM
architecture readable, navigable, and extensible.

## ✨ What’s New

### 🗺️ AI Panorama Map
- A layered cartography (L0–L3) that positions modern AI methods, debates, and systems
- Clarifies why many AGI discussions fail by collapsing layers
- Establishes DBM as a **structural intelligence paradigm**, not a model variant

### 🧱 Structural Foundations (Tier S)
- **IRStarmap** — a general IR layer for cross-domain structural reasoning
- **Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence**
- **CCC (Compression with Causality)** as the minimal reusable intelligence unit
- A structural solution to the sequence “thousand-claw dragon” problem

### ⚙️ Algorithmic Backbone (Tier A)
- ACLM gap geometry (horizontal + vertical bridging)
- UnalignedAND-BTP fish-control backbone
- Hybrid differential trees (Euclidean routing + metric execution)
- Sequence CCC Kernel as a cross-domain consensus core

## 🧭 How to Use This Release

- **New readers**: start with the AI Panorama Map and the Summary Book
- **Engineers**: follow Tier A ITEMS and DBM-COA mappings
- **Researchers**: use the Summary Book to locate ideas by layer and role

This release is designed to **orient**, not overwhelm.
