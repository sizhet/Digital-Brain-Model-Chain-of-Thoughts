# DBM Roadmap  
## Structural Readiness Before Capability Claims

This roadmap describes the **structural evolution path** of the Digital Brain Model (DBM).

It does **not** promise performance milestones, benchmarks, or timelines toward AGI.
Instead, it defines **what structural components must exist** before higher-level intelligence
can be meaningfully discussed or evaluated.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Structure precedes capability**  
   Intelligence cannot reliably exceed its structural support.

2. **Navigation before acceleration**  
   A system must be readable and debuggable before it is optimized.

3. **Evolution before scale**  
   Structural evolution matters more than parameter growth.

4. **Governance is not optional**  
   Long-lived intelligence requires built-in constraints.

## Phase Overview

### Phase I — DBM-COT (Chain of Thoughts)
**Status:** Active / Foundational

Focus:
- Structural ontology of intelligence
- IR, CCC, differential trees, search control
- Evaluation beyond benchmarks
- Governance and safety framing

Deliverables:
- ITEM documents (conceptual and structural)
- Panorama-level navigation
- Research trace (Conversation PDFs)

> Release 1.1 and Release 1.2 belong to this phase.

---

### Phase II — DBM-COA (Chain of Algorithms)
**Status:** Emerging / Selective

Focus:
- Algorithmic realizations of DBM-COT structures
- Reference implementations, not production systems
- Explicit contracts, stop rules, and control surfaces

Deliverables:
- Code skeletons aligned with DBM-COT
- Engineering demonstrations of structure
- No claims of completeness or optimality

---

### Phase III — DBM-COS (Chain of Solutions)
**Status:** Future / Conditional

Focus:
- Domain-specific systems built on DBM-COA
- Long-horizon applications (finance, biology, behavior, governance)
- Evidence of structural reuse across domains

Deliverables:
- Application frameworks
- Evaluation under real constraints
- Structural transfer demonstrations

---

## What This Roadmap Does *Not* Commit To

- AGI timelines  
- End-to-end autonomous agents  
- Replacement of existing AI paradigms  
- Benchmark domination  

DBM is a **structural substrate**, not a race entrant.

---

## Release 1.2 Position in the Roadmap

Release 1.2 completes **structural navigation**:
- AI Panorama Map
- Clear layer separation
- Entry paths for readers, engineers, and researchers

It marks a transition from *idea accumulation* to *structural clarity*.

That transition is intentional and necessary.
