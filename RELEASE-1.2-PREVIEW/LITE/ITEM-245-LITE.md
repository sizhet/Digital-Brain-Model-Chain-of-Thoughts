# ITEM #245 – DBM Structure Intelligence Agent: From Algorithms to Agents, from Intelligence to Transferable Structure

File: ITEM-245-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM elevates DBM from a collection of algorithms to a Structure Intelligence Agent (SIA), emphasizing agents whose primary asset is transferable structure rather than task-specific skills.

## Core Idea

Agents are carriers of structure

Transferability defines intelligence utility

Algorithms compose into governed agents

## Why It Matters

Researchers: reframes agent design

Engineers: builds reusable agents

AI systems: beyond task-bound autonomy

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Agents / SIA
