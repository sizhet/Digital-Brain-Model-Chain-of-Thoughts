# ITEM #234 – Hybrid Early-Stop Acceleration for UnalignedAND-BTP

File: ITEM-234-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM presents hybrid early-stop strategies for large-vs-large UnalignedAND-BTP searches, balancing recall, precision, and compute budgets through explicit stop contracts.

## Core Idea

Not all completeness is worth pursuing

Early stop is a structural decision

Hybrid modes dominate extremes

## Why It Matters

Engineers: cost-bounded search

Researchers: formal stop-rule design

Systems: predictable latency

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Search / Stop-Rules

Related ITEMs: #229, #230
