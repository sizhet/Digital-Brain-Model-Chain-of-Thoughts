# ITEM #249 – Structural Tensions Between RAG, Continual Learning, and Backprop-Based Generalization

File: ITEM-249-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM analyzes structural conflicts among RAG, continual learning, and backprop-based generalization, explaining why naive combinations lead to instability and how DBM mitigates these tensions.

## Core Idea

RAG and backprop pull in opposite directions

Continual learning amplifies conflicts

Structural governance is required

## Why It Matters

Researchers: clarifies failure modes

Engineers: safer system integration

AI systems: stability over accumulation

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Safety / Learning

Related ITEMs: #250, #251
