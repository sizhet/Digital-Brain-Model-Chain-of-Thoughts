# ITEM #214 – A Next-Generation X-Features IR & Interaction Architecture

File: ITEM-214-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM introduces a next-generation IR architecture that anchors features structurally, integrates external events, and enables controlled evolution across interactions.

## Core Idea

Features are structurally anchored

Interaction is first-class

Evolution is governed, not accidental

## Why It Matters

Researchers: structured interaction modeling

Engineers: scalable IR pipelines

Systems: controlled adaptability

## Relation to DBM

Layer: IR / Architecture
