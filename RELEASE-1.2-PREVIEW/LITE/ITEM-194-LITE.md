# ITEM #194 – Post-Turing Evaluation: Entropy, Structure, and Self-Consistent Intelligence

File: ITEM-194-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM proposes evaluation principles beyond Turing-style tests, incorporating entropy control, structural consistency, and internal coherence as primary signals of intelligence.

## Core Idea

Output realism is insufficient

Intelligence must maintain internal structure

Self-consistency matters more than deception

## Why It Matters

Researchers: new evaluation axes

Engineers: robust system testing

AI assessment: post-Turing criteria

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Evaluation
