# ITEM #197 – Sequence, Graph, and Image: A Year-End Structural Reflection on DBM (2025)

File: ITEM-197-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

A reflective synthesis of how DBM structural principles manifest across sequence, graph, and image domains, highlighting convergent patterns discovered in 2025.

## Core Idea

Different domains share structural invariants

Representation differs; structure repeats

DBM generalizes across modalities

## Why It Matters

Researchers: cross-domain validation

Engineers: reusable architectures

AI design: modality-agnostic structure

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Synthesis
