# ITEM #251 – CCC Density, Deductive Weakness, and LLM Path Selection

File: ITEM-251-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM studies how CCC density influences deductive strength and LLM path selection, explaining why dense CCC regions can mislead reasoning without structural oversight.

## Core Idea

Density biases path choice

Deduction weakens under overload

Structure restores balance

## Why It Matters

Researchers: explains reasoning errors

Engineers: improves path selection

AI design: guided inference

## Relation to DBM

Layer: CCC / Reasoning
