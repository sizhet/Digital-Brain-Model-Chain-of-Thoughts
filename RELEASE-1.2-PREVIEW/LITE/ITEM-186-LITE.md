# ITEM #186 – LLM as How-Machine vs DBM as What-Engine

File: ITEM-186-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM distinguishes two complementary intelligence roles: LLMs excel at generating procedures (“how”), while DBM determines goals, constraints, and structural priorities (“what”). The distinction resolves common misinterpretations of LLM limitations.

## Core Idea

“How” generation is not “what” selection

Decision authority must be structural

LLM and DBM are complementary, not competing

## Why It Matters

Researchers: avoids category errors

Engineers: enables correct system composition

AI architecture: motivates hybrid designs

## Relation to DBM

Layer: LLM–DBM Boundary
