# ITEM #193 – The Turing Window Fallacy vs Structural Intelligence

File: ITEM-193-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM critiques evaluation methods based on narrow performance windows (e.g., Turing-style tests), arguing that such metrics fail to measure structural understanding, stability, and long-term intelligence viability.

## Core Idea

Passing tests ≠ understanding

Performance windows mask structural absence

Evaluation must be structure-aware

## Why It Matters

Researchers: demands new benchmarks

Engineers: avoids metric overfitting

AI evaluation: beyond post-hoc success

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Evaluation
