# ITEM #192 – AGI Time Windows vs Structural Readiness

File: ITEM-192-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM argues that discussions of “AGI timelines” are meaningless without assessing structural readiness. Intelligence emergence depends on accumulated structure, not calendar milestones.

## Core Idea

Time is not the limiting factor

Structural maturity determines capability ceilings

Demonstrations ≠ sustainable intelligence

## Why It Matters

Researchers: recalibrates AGI discourse

Engineers: focuses effort on foundations

AI governance: resists hype cycles

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Strategy / Meta
