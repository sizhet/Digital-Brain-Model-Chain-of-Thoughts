# ITEM #246 – DBM-SIA and the Paradigm of Evolutionary Open-Source Systems

File: ITEM-246-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM proposes DBM-SIA as an evolutionary open-source paradigm, where intelligence systems evolve through transparent structural contributions rather than opaque parameter updates.

## Core Idea

Open-source as evolutionary substrate

Structure evolves via contribution and selection

Governance replaces centralized control

## Why It Matters

Researchers: reproducible intelligence evolution

Engineers: collaborative system growth

AI ecosystems: sustainable development

## Relation to DBM

Layer: SIA / Governance
