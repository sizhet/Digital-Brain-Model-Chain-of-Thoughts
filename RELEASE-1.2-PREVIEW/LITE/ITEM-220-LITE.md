 # ITEM #220 – Pattern Family Augmentation for Structural Indexing in Time-Series IR Systems

File: ITEM-220-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM introduces pattern family augmentation as a method to expand structural recall in time-series IR systems without sacrificing precision. Instead of relying on single canonical patterns, DBM generates structurally equivalent variants to stabilize indexing and retrieval.

## Core Idea

One pattern is not enough for structure

Families preserve invariants while expanding coverage

Structural recall beats raw frequency

## Why It Matters

Researchers: formalizes pattern generalization

Engineers: improves recall without combinatorial blow-up

Systems: stabilizes long-horizon decisions

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Time-Series IR / Indexing
