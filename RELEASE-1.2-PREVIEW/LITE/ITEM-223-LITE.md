# ITEM #223 – Observer-Centric Trajectory Time-Series IR Schema

File: ITEM-223-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM specifies the schema underlying observer-centric trajectory IR, defining minimal primitives and relationships required for structural motion reasoning.

## Core Idea

Schema precedes learning

Minimal primitives enable generality

Structure constrains inference

## Why It Matters

Engineers: concrete schema for implementation

Researchers: avoids ad-hoc representations

Systems: interoperable motion IR

## Relation to DBM

Layer: IR Schema
