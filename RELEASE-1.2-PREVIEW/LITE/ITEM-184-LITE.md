# ITEM #184 – Duality of DBM: ACLM Structural Intelligence and LLM Generative Intelligence

File: ITEM-184-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM formalizes the dual structure of DBM systems: ACLM provides structural intelligence for decision, planning, and evolution, while LLMs provide generative capacity. Intelligence emerges from governed interaction, not dominance by either side.

## Core Idea

Structure vs generation are orthogonal

ACLM governs feasibility and evolution

LLMs act as proposal engines

## Why It Matters

Researchers: resolves hybrid AI confusion

Engineers: enables stable orchestration

Architecture: avoids tool dominance

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Architecture
