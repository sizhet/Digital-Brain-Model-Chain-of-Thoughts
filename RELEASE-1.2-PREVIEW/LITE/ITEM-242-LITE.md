# ITEM #242 – Sequence CCC Kernel: A Cross-Domain CCC Core

File: ITEM-242-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM defines the Sequence CCC Kernel as a reusable core applicable to DNA, ACLM calling graphs, and LLM span mining, demonstrating CCC’s cross-domain generality.

## Core Idea

CCC kernel is domain-agnostic

Sequence structure recurs across domains

One kernel, many applications

## Why It Matters

Engineers: reuse instead of reinvention

Researchers: validates structural universality

AI systems: cross-domain leverage

## Relation to DBM

Layer: CCC Kernel
