# ITEM #236 – Two-Ways CCC Test Algorithm for Functional DNA Signal Detection

File: ITEM-236-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM introduces a Two-Ways CCC test for detecting functional DNA signals by comparing structural matches in both forward and reverse directions, improving robustness against noise and bias.

## Core Idea

One-way matching is insufficient

Structural symmetry increases confidence

CCC generalizes across biology

## Why It Matters

Researchers: functional genomics insight

Engineers: domain-agnostic CCC testing

AI systems: biology as structure

## Relation to DBM

Layer: CCC / Bio-Applications
