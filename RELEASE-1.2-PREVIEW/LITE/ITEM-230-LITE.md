# ITEM #230 – RTB Acceleration for UnalignedAND-BTP

File: ITEM-230-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM introduces RTB (Route-Tree-Based) acceleration to reduce the effective search space of UnalignedAND-BTP while preserving correctness guarantees.

## Core Idea

Routing before combination

Early pruning via structure

Acceleration without heuristic drift

## Why It Matters

Engineers: order-of-magnitude speedups

Researchers: principled acceleration

Systems: scalable exact search

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Search Acceleration
