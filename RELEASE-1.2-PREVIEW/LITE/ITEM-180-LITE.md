# ITEM #180 – CCC as the Compression Core of Structural Intelligence

File: ITEM-180-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

CCC (Common Concept Core) is defined as the compression nucleus of structural intelligence. Unlike statistical compression, CCC preserves decision-equivalent structure, enabling abstraction without sacrificing reasoning capability.

## Core Idea

CCC ≠ data compression

CCC preserves decision invariants

CCC is the atomic unit of DBM reasoning and evolution

## Why It Matters

Researchers: bridges cognition and computation

Engineers: enables controllable generalization

AI design: surpasses token-level reductionism

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Core Mechanism
