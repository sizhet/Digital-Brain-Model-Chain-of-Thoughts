File: ITEM-196-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM reframes CCC as a post-hoc evolutionary structure that emerges from accumulated decisions and experiences, rather than a predefined ontology.

## Core Idea

Structure is distilled from action

Evolution is structure-first

## Why It Matters

Researchers: links evolution and abstraction

Engineers: supports continual systems

AI theory: avoids static concept taxonomies
