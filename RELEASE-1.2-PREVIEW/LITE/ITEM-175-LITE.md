# ITEM #175 – 2026 DBM Roadmap: From Chain of Thoughts to Chain of Solutions

File: ITEM-175-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM outlines the 2026 evolution path of DBM, moving from Chain-of-Thought (COT) artifacts toward Chain-of-Algorithms (COA) and ultimately Chain-of-Solutions (COS). The roadmap emphasizes structural readiness, engineering deliverables, and reproducible intelligence infrastructure rather than speculative end-to-end breakthroughs.

## Core Idea

COT → COA → COS as a staged intelligence pipeline

Structure precedes performance

Each phase yields concrete engineering artifacts

## Why It Matters

Researchers: clarifies falsifiable milestones

Engineers: identifies actionable development stages

AI planning: avoids AGI rhetoric without infrastructure

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Meta / Roadmap
