# ITEM #254 – Two-Ways CCC over Starmap Spaces

File: ITEM-254-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM introduces a two-ways CCC engine over starmap spaces, enabling comparative structural signal analysis with symmetry and robustness guarantees.

## Core Idea

Comparison must be bidirectional

Starmaps provide structural context

Two-ways CCC increases confidence

## Why It Matters

Researchers: general comparative engine

Engineers: robust signal scoring

AI systems: reliable structure comparison

## Relation to DBM

Layer: CCC / Comparative Engines
