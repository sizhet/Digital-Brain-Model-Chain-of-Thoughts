# ITEM #217 – Why Time Series Have Not Exhibited Emergent Intelligence

File: ITEM-217-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM analyzes why time-series domains have not shown emergent intelligence, attributing the limitation to metric-space simplicity and lack of structural diversity.

## Core Idea

Time series are structurally constrained

Emergence requires structure, not volume

DBM reframes the problem

## Why It Matters

Researchers: corrects data-centric assumptions

Engineers: avoids brute-force scaling

AI research: identifies missing structure

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Time-Series Foundations
