# ITEM #229 – UnalignedAND-BTP Fish-Control Backbone

File: ITEM-229-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM formalizes the UnalignedAND-BTP backbone as a “fish-control” mechanism, combining exactness guards, recall modes, and anti-leak contracts to manage combinatorial search safely.

## Core Idea

Exactness must be guarded

Recall requires controlled relaxation

Stop-rules prevent combinatorial collapse

## Why It Matters

Engineers: safe large-scale search

Researchers: principled control of AND explosion

Systems: predictable performance

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Search / Control

Related ITEMs: #230, #234
