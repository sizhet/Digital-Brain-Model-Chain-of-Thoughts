# ITEM #219 – Time-Series IR Top Requirements

File: ITEM-219-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM defines top-level requirements for time-series IR systems, emphasizing task–action duality and flow-shop runtime architectures.

## Core Idea

Time-series need task context

Action and observation must align

Runtime design is decisive

## Why It Matters

Engineers: actionable requirements

Researchers: avoids abstract dead-ends

Systems: real-time decision loops

## Relation to DBM
