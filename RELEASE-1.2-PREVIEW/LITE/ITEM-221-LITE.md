# ITEM #221 – Full Application Stack of Time-Series IR Systems

File: ITEM-221-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM presents the complete application stack for time-series IR systems, from offline structural discovery to online metric-space decision loops, emphasizing end-to-end coherence.

## Core Idea

Offline structure enables online speed

Discovery and decision must be coupled

IR is the spine of the stack

## Why It Matters

Engineers: deployable system blueprint

Researchers: closes the loop from theory to runtime

AI systems: avoids fragmented pipelines

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Time-Series Systems
