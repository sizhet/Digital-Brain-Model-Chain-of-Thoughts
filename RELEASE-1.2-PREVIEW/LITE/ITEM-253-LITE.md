# ITEM #253 – Minimal Evolution Threshold, Path Dependency, and the Limits of World Models

File: ITEM-253-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM formalizes the minimal evolution threshold concept, showing how path dependency constrains intelligence growth and why world models alone cannot overcome these limits.

## Core Idea

Evolution has entry thresholds

Paths constrain outcomes

Structure determines reachability

## Why It Matters

Researchers: evolutionary realism

Engineers: avoids dead-end designs

AI theory: structural necessity

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Evolution / Foundations
