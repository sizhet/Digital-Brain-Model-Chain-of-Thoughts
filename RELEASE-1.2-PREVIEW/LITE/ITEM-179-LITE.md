# ITEM #179 – Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence

File: ITEM-179-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM advances the core DBM thesis that intelligence resides in transferable, comparable structure rather than in parameter values or raw experience. Structures persist, migrate, and compose across tasks, while parameters decay with distributional shift.

## Core Idea

Parameters are transient; structure is durable

Learning populates structure, but does not define it

Intelligence transfer equals structure transfer

## Why It Matters

Researchers: reframes the ontology of intelligence

Engineers: enables reusable intelligence systems

AI theory: breaks parameter-centric assumptions

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Foundations / Philosophy
