# ITEM #226 – Non-Numeric Time-Series IR & Structural Causality

File: ITEM-226-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM extends time-series IR beyond numeric signals to discrete, causal, and symbolic events, enabling structural causality analysis in social, behavioral, and decision systems.

## Core Idea

Causality is not always numeric

Structure reveals non-metric relations

Time-series can encode intent and influence

## Why It Matters

Researchers: broadens time-series scope

Engineers: models behavior and interaction

AI systems: social and strategic domains

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Structural Causality
