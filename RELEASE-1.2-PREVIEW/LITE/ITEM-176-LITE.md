# ITEM #176 – The Limits of World-Model Simulation and the Myth of Replaying Human Evolution

File: ITEM-176-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM critiques the assumption that sufficiently detailed world-model simulation can replay human evolution to produce intelligence. It argues that such approaches fail due to irreversibility, path dependency, and infeasible causal reconstruction, and positions DBM’s structural intelligence as a more realistic alternative.

## Core Idea

Evolution cannot be replayed or reversed

Simulation ≠ structural understanding

Intelligence requires anchored structure, not total imitation

## Why It Matters

Researchers: corrects a dominant conceptual error

Engineers: avoids unbounded simulation costs

AI strategy: motivates structural approaches

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Foundations
