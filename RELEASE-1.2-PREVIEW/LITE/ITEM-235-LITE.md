# ITEM #235 – Hybrid Tree of Euclidean Differential Tree and Metric Differential Tree

File: ITEM-235-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM proposes a hybrid tree architecture combining Euclidean differential trees for routing and metric differential trees for reasoning, achieving speed without sacrificing metric validity.

## Core Idea

Routing ≠ reasoning

Euclidean trees route, metric trees decide

Hybridization dominates single-tree designs

## Why It Matters

Engineers: fast yet correct search

Researchers: clean separation of concerns

Systems: scalable metric reasoning

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Indexing / Trees
