# ITEM #218 – Third-Person Perspective and Anti-Minimal-Evolution Algorithms

File: ITEM-218-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM studies third-person perspective and anti-minimal-evolution algorithms, clarifying their role and limits in the broader intelligence landscape.

## Core Idea

Perspective affects intelligence class

Anti-minimal paths trade efficiency for coverage

DBM balances both

## Why It Matters

Researchers: perspective-aware modeling

Engineers: algorithm selection clarity

AI theory: avoids perspective confusion

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Meta / Perspective
