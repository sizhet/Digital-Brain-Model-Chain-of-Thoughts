# ITEM #174 – Yann LeCun’s AI Trajectory and the Strategic Window for DBM

File: ITEM-174-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM analyzes Yann LeCun’s long-term AI trajectory and identifies a strategic window where DBM-style structural intelligence becomes both necessary and competitive. Rather than engaging in ideological debate, it positions DBM as a structural complement to representation learning.

## Core Idea

LeCun’s critique targets LLM overreach, not structure

Representation learning lacks decision structure

DBM fills the missing structural layer

## Why It Matters

Researchers: clarifies alignment vs divergence

Engineers: avoids false paradigm wars

AI strategy: identifies timing and opportunity

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Meta / Strategy
