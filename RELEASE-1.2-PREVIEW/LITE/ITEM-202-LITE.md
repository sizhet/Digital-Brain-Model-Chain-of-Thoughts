# ITEM #202 – A Unified Evaluation Framework for Three Intelligence Paradigms

File: ITEM-202-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM proposes a unified evaluation framework covering statistical intelligence, structural intelligence, and KD-CPI. It addresses systematic bias introduced by single-paradigm benchmarks.

## Core Idea

Different intelligence types require distinct metrics

Unified comparison requires structural separation

Evaluation must reflect long-term viability

## Why It Matters

Researchers: enables fair paradigm comparison

Engineers: prevents misleading KPIs

AI policy: supports grounded assessment

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Evaluation Framework
