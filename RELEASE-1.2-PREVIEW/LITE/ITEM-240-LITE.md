# ITEM #240 – Sequence CCC, Hydra Explosion, and the Minimal Evolution Threshold Solution

File: ITEM-240-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM analyzes the “Hydra explosion” problem in sequence CCC and presents the minimal evolution threshold as a structural solution that avoids combinatorial growth.

## Core Idea

Sequence CCC faces combinatorial hydras

Minimal evolution constrains growth

Structure beats brute force

## Why It Matters

Researchers: principled sequence intelligence

Engineers: scalable sequence reasoning

AI design: avoids exponential traps

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Sequence CCC
