# ITEM #222 – Observer-Centric Trajectory Time-Series IR for Flight and Animal Motion

File: ITEM-222-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM defines observer-centric trajectory IR, enabling motion analysis relative to frames, forces, and interactions rather than absolute coordinates. It supports both physical and biological motion understanding.

## Core Idea

Motion is relational, not absolute

Observer frame defines structure

Trajectories encode interaction

## Why It Matters

Researchers: unifies physics and behavior

Engineers: robust motion analysis

AI applications: flight, robotics, ethology

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Motion / Time-Series IR
