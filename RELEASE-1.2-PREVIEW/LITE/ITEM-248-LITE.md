# ITEM #248 – A Unified Algorithmic Model of LLM and DBM

File: ITEM-248-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

This ITEM presents a unified two-phase intelligence model in which LLMs generate candidates while DBM evaluates, governs, and commits decisions, forming a stable hybrid intelligence architecture.

## Core Idea

Generation and governance are separate phases

DBM enforces structural consistency

Hybrid intelligence is the default future

## Why It Matters

Researchers: resolves LLM–DBM integration

Engineers: clear system boundaries

AI design: scalable hybrid architectures

## Relation to DBM

Layer: Unified Model
