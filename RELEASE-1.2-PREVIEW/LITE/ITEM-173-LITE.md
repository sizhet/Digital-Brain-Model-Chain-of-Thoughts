# ITEM #173 – IRStarmap: A General IR Layer for Structural Intelligence

File: ITEM-173-LITE.md

## One-Paragraph Summary

IRStarmap introduces a unified Intermediate Representation (IR) layer designed to support structural intelligence across heterogeneous domains, including language, code, graphs, sequences, and time-series. Rather than serving as a feature-engineering technique, IRStarmap defines a shared structural coordinate system that enables downstream mechanisms—such as CCC, differential trees, and two-phase search—to operate consistently and comparably.

## Core Idea

IR aligns structure, not raw data or tokens

Different modalities converge into a comparable structural space

IR is the prerequisite for all higher-level DBM reasoning

## Why It Matters

Researchers: establishes a common structural substrate across tasks

Engineers: avoids rebuilding reasoning systems per modality

AI trajectory: intelligence bottlenecks shift from models to IR design

## Relation to DBM

Layer: IR / Structural Input Layer
