# ENTRY — New Readers  
## A Gentle Entry into Structural Intelligence (DBM-COT)

Welcome to **DBM-COT (Digital Brain Model — Chain of Thoughts)**.

This project is large by design.  
You are **not expected to read everything**, and you should not try to.

This entry is here to help you **build orientation first**, not mastery.

---

## First Things First (Please Read This)

DBM-COT is **not**:

- a single model  
- a benchmark leaderboard  
- a prompt engineering guide  
- a claim about AGI timelines  

DBM-COT **is**:

- a **structural intelligence framework**
- focused on reusable structure, not parameter scale
- designed for long-term accumulation of intelligence

If you are looking for quick demos or immediate results,  
this may not be the right repository.

If you are interested in **how intelligence can be structured, controlled, evaluated, and governed**,  
you are in the right place.

## How to Read DBM-COT (Three Document Layers)

You will encounter **three types of documents** in this repository.
They are designed to be read at different depths.

### 1️⃣ LITE (Markdown) — Start Here
- Short, English navigation files
- Explain *what an ITEM is about* and *where it fits structurally*
- Optimized for GitHub online reading
- **Not a substitute** for the full paper

👉 As a new reader, **start with LITE files only**.

---

### 2️⃣ ITEM (PDF) — Read When Interested
- Formal technical write-ups
- Full arguments, diagrams, definitions
- Citable via DOI
- Intended for deep study

👉 Move to ITEM PDFs **only after** LITE gives you context.

---

### 3️⃣ Conversation (PDF) — Optional but Unique
- Complete human–AI reasoning history
- Design debates, corrections, and evolution paths
- Treated as a **first-class research artifact**

👉 Read these if you are curious *how* ideas were formed.

---

## ⚠️ Note on GitHub PDF Rendering

Some PDF files may **not render correctly** in GitHub’s online viewer due to platform limitations.

**Recommended approach:**
- For browsing → read **LITE Markdown files**
- For full fidelity → **download the repository** and read PDFs locally

This is a GitHub constraint, not a document quality issue.

---

## Recommended Starting Point (Tier S)

You only need **5 ITEMS** to understand what DBM is about.

Read their **LITE versions** in this order:

1. **AI Panorama Map** — ITEM #252  
   *A global, layered map of modern AI and where DBM fits.*

2. **Structure as the Carrier of Intelligence** — ITEM #179  
   *Why structure, not parameters, carries intelligence.*

3. **CCC as the Compression Core of Structural Intelligence** — ITEM #180  
   *What CCC is, and why it matters.*

4. **IRStarmap: A General IR Layer** — ITEM #173  
   *How heterogeneous problems enter a shared structural space.*

5. **Two-Ways CCC over Starmap Spaces** — ITEM #254  
   *How DBM compares structural signals robustly.*

After these five, you already understand **the core philosophy and mechanics**.

---

## What You Can Safely Skip (For Now)

- Detailed algorithm acceleration
- Large-vs-large search optimization
- Domain-specific applications (DNA, motion, sequence kernels)
- Governance and AI safety discussions

These will make much more sense **after** structural foundations are clear.

---

## If You Want to Continue (Optional Paths)

### Curious Reader
- ITEM #186 — LLM as How-Machine vs DBM as What-Engine  
- ITEM #192 — AGI Time Windows vs Structural Readiness  

### Engineering-Oriented
→ Go to: `ENTRY-ENGINEERS.md`

### Research / Theory-Oriented
→ Go to: `ENTRY-RESEARCHERS.md`

## A Final Note for New Readers

DBM-COT is written with a long time horizon.

It does not attempt to impress with demos.  
It attempts to **build something that can last**.

Take your time.  
Structure rewards patience.
