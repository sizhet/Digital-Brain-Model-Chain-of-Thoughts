# DBM-SI Structural Octagon → ITEM Mapping (Initial Classification)

This document provides an initial structural classification of DBM-COT ITEMs
according to the DBM-SI Structural Octagon coverage model.

This mapping is not exclusive — many ITEMs span multiple structural layers.
The goal is to provide a **reader-oriented structural index**.

## I. Localization
Candidate-space reduction and structural routing.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #232 — Hybrid Large-Large Search Strategy
- ITEM #233 — Hybrid Differential Tree
- ITEM #242 — Two-Phase tolerant token search + scan scoring

---

## II. Metric Distance
Similarity measurement and alignment scoring.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #232 — Hybrid metric-localization search
- ITEM #234 — Two-Ways Graph CCC Scoring
- ITEM #258 — Two-Ways Graph CCC Advanced Scoring

---

## III. CCC (Common Concept Core)
Structural core formation and signal detection.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #230 — CCC Cache Overflow and Intelligence Degradation Law

- ITEM #257 — GapBridgingStarmap (ΔΔ Knowledge)
- ITEM #258 — CCC Signal Scoring
- ITEM #261 — Alignment Dispatcher (partial)

---

## IV. Alignment Dispatching / Routing
Alignment strategy selection and perspective routing.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #233 — Hybrid Differential Tree (routing role)

---

## V. Rules Engines
Decision synthesis and structural prediction.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #246 — RAG vs Reverse-Generalization Conflict
- ITEM #247 — AI Safety × RAG × DBM
- ITEM #252 — DBM Position Paper (rules-layer synthesis)
- ITEM #253 — AI Panorama Map
- ITEM #255 — AI Regulation Paradigm

---

## VI. ACLM (Action-Calling Layer Model)
Task-action execution structure.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #223 — DBM Continuation Pipeline
- ITEM #254 — Evolution Policy Integration
- ITEM #257 — Gap Bridging
- ITEM #258 — Offline Scoring Pipeline

---

## VII. IR (Representation Layer)
Structured representation of observable systems.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #218 — Pattern Family Generation
- ITEM #219 — Time-Series Structural Intelligence Pipeline
- ITEM #224 — Non-Numeric Time-Series IR
- ITEM #225 — Motion IR Stack
- ITEM #226 — Motion IR Interaction Extensions

---

## VIII. APTGOE / MET
Structural evolution governance layer.

Representative ITEMs:

- ITEM #254 — Minimal Evolution Threshold
- ITEM #257 — ΔΔ Knowledge Evolution
- ITEM #260 — Flood-Response Mechanism
- ITEM #261 — Alignment Dispatcher (evolution role)

---

## Notes

This mapping represents an initial structural classification of DBM-COT ITEMs.
As the DBM ecosystem evolves, ITEM placement may be refined.

The Structural Octagon serves as a **coverage model for structural intelligence systems**
under the Minimal Evolution Threshold (MET) principle.
