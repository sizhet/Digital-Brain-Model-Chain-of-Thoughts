# DBM-COT — Digital Brain Model  
## Chain of Thoughts for Structural Intelligence

DBM-COT (Chain of Thoughts) is the **conceptual and structural backbone** of the Digital Brain Model (DBM).

It defines **structural intelligence** as an intelligence paradigm built on explicit representations,
differential trees, reusable consensus cores (CCC), and governed evolution —
rather than scale-driven parameter optimization or end-to-end black-box training.

DBM-COT is not a model, not a benchmark, and not a prompt framework.  
It is a **structural intelligence architecture**.

## What Problem Does DBM Address?

Modern AI systems excel at generation, pattern fitting, and short-horizon reasoning,
but struggle with:

- Reusable intelligence across tasks and domains  
- Structural control of combinatorial explosion  
- Long-term consistency, evaluation, and governance  
- Accumulation of intelligence beyond retraining cycles  

DBM approaches these problems by treating **structure—not parameters—as the carrier of intelligence**.

## Document Layers (How to Read This Repository)

DBM-COT provides **three complementary document layers**.
They serve different reading depths and purposes.

### 📄 LITE (Markdown)
**Navigation and orientation layer.**

- Written in concise English
- Designed for GitHub online reading
- Explains *what each ITEM is about* and *where it fits structurally*
- **Not a substitute** for the full paper

→ Start here if you are new or browsing.

---

### 📘 ITEM (PDF)
**Formal technical content.**

- Authoritative write-up
- Citable via DOI
- Contains full arguments, diagrams, definitions, and structure
- Intended for serious study and reference

---

### 🧠 Conversation (PDF)
**Research trace and co-evolution record.**

- Complete human–AI reasoning history
- Design decisions, corrections, and alternative paths
- Treated as a **first-class research artifact**, not an appendix

> Readers are encouraged to choose the layer appropriate to their depth and intent.

## ⚠️ Note on GitHub PDF Rendering

Some PDF files in this repository may **not render correctly in GitHub’s online viewer**
due to platform limitations (fonts, annotations, size).

**Recommended reading paths:**

- For quick orientation → read the **English LITE Markdown files**
- For full fidelity → **download the repository** and read PDFs locally

This is a GitHub platform constraint, not a document integrity issue.

## AI 4-Layers Reference Model

| Layer | Name | Role |
|------:|------|------|
| L0 | Structural Substrate | IR, metric spaces, differential trees |
| L1 | Structural Algorithms | CCC, gap bridging, search, acceleration |
| L2 | Intelligence Mechanisms | reasoning, evaluation, KD-CPI, evolution |
| L3 | Systems & Civilization | agents, safety, governance, open evolution |

This layered model is the **global coordinate system** for navigating DBM.
