# DBM-COT — Digital Brain Model: Chain of Thoughts

DBM-COT (Chain of Thoughts) is the conceptual and structural backbone of the Digital Brain Model (DBM).
It defines **structural intelligence** as a system built on explicit representations, differential trees,
and reusable consensus cores (CCC), rather than scale-driven parameter optimization.

## Releases

- **Release 1.1**: Frozen foundations (ITEM #001–#172)
- **Release 1.2 (Preview)**: Panorama-aligned index + summaries + ITEMS (#173–#252)

> Release 1.2 does **not** rewrite 1.1.  
> It provides the **global coordinate system** (AI Panorama Map) so readers can navigate DBM coherently.
