# DBM-COT Release 1.2  
## Panorama-Aligned Structural Preview

Release 1.2 is a **navigation and alignment release**.

It does not replace Release 1.1.
It does not invalidate earlier ITEMS.
It does not introduce performance claims.

Its purpose is to make the DBM system **globally readable**.

---

## What Release 1.2 Is

- A **structural panorama** of DBM-COT
- A layer-aligned organization of ITEM #173–#255
- A clarification of how DBM relates to modern AI discourse
- A foundation for future algorithmic and system work

---

## What Release 1.2 Is Not

- Not a rewrite of foundations
- Not an AGI announcement
- Not a benchmark-driven release
- Not a production-ready system

Release 1.2 optimizes **orientation**, not capability.

---

## Key Contributions

### 1. AI Panorama Map
A layered cartography positioning:
- statistical learning
- generative models
- structural intelligence
- governance and civilization-scale systems

This map resolves many apparent contradictions in AI debates.

---

### 2. Structural Foundations Consolidation
Including:
- IRStarmap as a general IR layer
- CCC as the minimal reusable intelligence unit
- Differential trees and search control
- Minimal evolution threshold

These form the **structural spine** of DBM.

---

### 3. Evaluation and Governance Framing
Release 1.2 explicitly integrates:
- Post-Turing evaluation
- KD-CPI
- Structural AI safety
- Governance without innovation suppression

---

## How to Use This Release

- **New readers:** start with LITE files and the Panorama Map  
- **Engineers:** follow IR → CCC → Trees → Search  
- **Researchers:** focus on ontology, evaluation, and governance  

This release is designed to **orient**, not overwhelm.

## Relationship to Release 1.1

| Aspect | Release 1.1 | Release 1.2 |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Role | Foundations | Navigation |
| Scope | ITEM #001–#172 | ITEM #173–#255 |
| Status | Stable / Frozen | Preview |
| Purpose | Establish structure | Make structure readable |

Both releases are necessary.
Neither supersedes the other.
