# DBM-COT Summary v1.2  
## Structural Intelligence at a Glance

This summary provides a **high-level structural overview** of DBM-COT.

It is not a replacement for ITEM documents.
It is a **map**, not the territory.

---

## Core Thesis

> Intelligence is carried by **structure**, not parameters.

DBM treats intelligence as:
- reusable
- comparable
- evolvable
- governable

---

## Structural Stack Overview

### Structural Input
- IRStarmap
- X-Features
- Observer-centric representations

### Structural Compression
- CCC (Common Concept Core)
- Post-hoc evolutionary structure
- Consensus kernels

### Structural Control
- Differential trees
- Fish-control search backbones
- Explicit stop rules

### Intelligence Mechanisms
- Reasoning and comparison
- KD-CPI
- Structural evaluation

### Systems & Governance
- Structure Intelligence Agents (SIA)
- Safety beyond prompts
- Open evolutionary governance

## Why DBM Is Different

DBM does not ask:
> “Can we generate intelligent behavior?”

It asks:
> “Can intelligence be **stably accumulated**?”

This shift leads to:
- less hype
- slower claims
- stronger foundations

---

## Reading Strategy

- Use **LITE files** for navigation
- Use **ITEM PDFs** for depth
- Use **Conversation PDFs** for research trace

You are not expected to read everything.

---

## Closing Perspective

DBM-COT v1.2 represents a point where:
- the structure is explicit
- the boundaries are clear
- the claims are controlled

From here, further progress depends not on speculation,
but on **structural execution**.
