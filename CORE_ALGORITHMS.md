# DBM Core Algorithms

## The Engineering Backbone of Structural Intelligence

---

## L0 — Spatial Organization Algorithms

### Variable-Size Blocks Index and Search

* Eliminates degeneration in fixed-fanout indexing structures;
* Provides stable complexity under uneven spatial distributions.

---

### Euclidean Space Points Tree

* Improves upon KD-Tree–style approaches in practical engineering scenarios;
* Used for fast candidate retrieval in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

---

### Metric Space Points Tree

* Supports non-Euclidean distance functions;
* Serves as the primary representation of real-world structures in DBM.

---

## L1 — Structural Matching and Distance

### Metric Space Distance

* Not a scalar function, but a structural comparison framework;
* Supports decomposition, weighting, and multi-path evaluation.

---

### UnalignedAND

* The atomic operator of DBM’s structural intelligence;
* Enables matching and comparison without predefined alignment.

---

### Bucket Tree of Permutations (BTP)

* Finds optimal bindings between structure components under constraints;
* Enables structure prediction and large-scale compositional reasoning.

---

### Common Concept Core (CCC)

* The “mean operator” in unaligned structural space;
* Used for clustering, concept stabilization, and rule extraction.

---

## L2 — Rules, Language, and Evolution

### Rules Engines

* Ordering, attribute, and causal reasoning engines;
* Translate structural relations into executable decisions.

---

### Event Language Model (ELM)

* Structured semantic representation for event sequences;
* Enables lossless modeling of temporal and causal relations.

---

### ACLM / CCGL / Dual-CCGL

* Structural programming and meta-programming languages;
* Enable automatic repair, structural migration, and cross-language alignment.

---

### Fusion Cortex and APGOE

* Multi-engine coordination and arbitration layer;
* Establish a closed loop for goal-driven, self-evolving intelligence.

## Closing Note

Each algorithm in DBM exists not in isolation,
but as a **necessary step in an irreversible construction path**.

Implementing fragments yields tools.
Implementing the whole yields intelligence.
