# DBM-COT Roadmap

## The Chain-of-Thought of Structural Intelligence

---

## What “Chain-of-Thought” Means in DBM

In DBM-COT, “Chain-of-Thought” does **not** refer to intermediate textual reasoning used by language models.

It denotes:

> **a non-skippable causal chain of engineering and cognition.**

Each stage exists because the next one cannot be constructed without it.

## The Three Structural Layers of DBM

DBM’s core components form an irreversible ladder with three layers.

---

### L0 — Spatial Foundations

**Question addressed:**
Can information be organized stably, efficiently, and incrementally?

**Key components:**

* Variable-Size Blocks Index
* Euclidean Space Points Tree
* Metric Space Points Tree

These components form the **ground on which all higher intelligence stands**.

---

### L1 — Structural Intelligence Primitives

**Question addressed:**
How can heterogeneous, non-aligned structures be compared and composed?

**Key components:**

* Metric Space Distance
* UnalignedAND
* Bucket Tree of Permutations (BTP)
* Common Concept Core (CCC)

This layer defines the **minimal complete operator set** for structural intelligence.

---

### L2 — System-Level Synthesis and Evolution

**Question addressed:**
How does an intelligent system sustain, repair, and evolve itself?

**Key components:**

* Rules Engines
* Event Language Model (ELM)
* ACLM / CCGL / Dual-CCGL
* Fusion Cortex
* Autonomous Program & Goal Evolution (APGOE)

At this stage, DBM becomes a **living intelligent system**, not merely an algorithmic framework.

---

## Irreversibility Principle

The DBM roadmap is irreversible:

* L1 cannot exist without L0
* L2 cannot exist without L1

Skipping a layer does not accelerate progress—it **collapses the system**.

---

## How to Read This Roadmap

* New readers: start from L0 and proceed sequentially
* Engineers: identify the lowest missing layer in your system
* Researchers: treat each layer as a necessary condition, not an optional module
